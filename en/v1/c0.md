# Prologue: The Swamp

The morning mist clung to the marshlands surrounding Libre, drifting lazily across the water’s surface like a thin veil. Frogs croaked from the dense reeds, their voices rising and falling in an unsteady chorus. In the distance, a flock of cranes took flight, their wings cutting graceful arcs through the pale sky. For a brief moment, everything seemed quiet and serene.


The swamp was still. It was almost beautiful.

But beauty in the swamp was always fleeting. Beneath the surface, hidden among the tangled roots and thick mud, lay something else entirely. The water was stagnant, bloated with rotting leaves, dead insects, and forgotten trash. Mosquitoes swarmed above the still pools, their shrill buzzing relentless. Small fish swam through murky currents, chased by predatory eels that coiled in the shadows, waiting to strike.

Nothing in the swamp was truly what it seemed.

Near the heart of the city, Vasco Yahari knelt quietly in his garden, brushing soil from his hands. His back ached, but the familiar strain was preferable to the restless thoughts that crowded his mind. The garden was small—just a patch of herbs, a few vegetable beds, and a weathered bench tucked beneath a crooked mango tree—but it was his retreat.

He plucked a few ripe tomatoes from their vines and set them gently in a basket. As he worked, his gaze wandered toward the distant skyline of Libre. A haze hung over the city, dulling the outlines of its decaying rooftops and rusted spires. Somewhere out there, his son, Ivor, was still asleep, dreaming of the day ahead.

Vasco sighed, resting his elbows on his knees. His lips curled slightly, not in a smile, but in the resigned expression of a man who had learned too much, too late.

“This place looks fine,” he muttered to himself, brushing dirt from his fingers. “Until you see what’s underneath.”

The words came naturally, almost like a habit now. It was the same thought that had haunted him throughout his career—first as a soldier, and later as an officer of the Republic’s army. He had spent years trying to convince himself that the cracks in the system would fix themselves.

They hadn’t.

He’d come close to greatness, only to be reminded, time and again, that his place was not among the decision-makers. The Republic had its way of keeping people in line—those without the right bloodlines or friendships would never climb too high. And in the end, Vasco had walked away.

And yet, Ivor didn’t see it. His son was too young, too idealistic, too... stubborn. Vasco admired the boy’s passion, but it worried him. Ivor believed too much—in the system, in the government, in the promise that hard work would be rewarded. He still believed that the Republic was built on principles of justice and meritocracy, that those who failed simply hadn’t tried hard enough.

Vasco knew better. The swamp always looked peaceful until you stepped in—and then it swallowed you whole.

He stood slowly, brushing off his knees. His joints creaked in protest, but he ignored them, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. The sun had begun to rise, casting long shadows over the uneven brick paths of his garden.

Soon, Ivor would wake, full of plans and dreams, eager to prove himself in a world that would never be as fair as he thought. He’d learn that lesson soon enough.

Vasco just hoped it wouldn’t break him.
