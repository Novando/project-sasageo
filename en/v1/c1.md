# Prologue: Life in a Forgotten Corner

The morning air carried the scent of seawater mixed with decaying plant life, wrapping the city of Libre in its usual damp heaviness. The sun struggled to cut through the haze that clung to the rooftops, casting a dim glow over the crumbling buildings. Overhead, the occasional seagull screeched, drifting across the pale sky, while the low hum of mosquitoes filled the stagnant air. The canals, thick with algae, snaked lazily through the city’s swampy outskirts, reflecting the peeling facades of old houses and rusting streetlights.

A tattered flag of the Republic of Neo Insaid fluttered weakly in the town square, with the color of rounded white in red background. Though it looked neglected, it still hung as a quiet reminder of national unity—at least to some. Others in the city walked past it without a glance, too busy with their daily routines or simply indifferent to the government it represented.

Life in Libre meant enduring what others might consider intolerable: the mosquitoes, the pungent stench of stagnant water, broken roads that flooded every rainy season, and sidewalks littered with rubbish. But to Ivor Yahari, it was still home.

In a narrow two-story house tucked into the heart of downtown Libre, Ivor sat on the edge of his bed, lacing up his shoes. The worn leather, scuffed and cracked from three years of use, groaned with every tug of the laces. But they still fit, and that was good enough. From outside, his mother’s voice drifted up the stairs, calling him to breakfast.

He ignored her for a few more moments, tightening the laces until they were just right. Today was important. The final round of the school’s debate competition was in a few hours, and he had no intention of losing. This was his chance to prove himself.

He glanced at the old photo sitting on his dresser—a snapshot from years ago, showing a younger Ivor perched on the shoulders of his father, Vasco Yahari. Vasco, dressed in his military uniform, stood with his arms crossed in front of a tank, his expression both proud and stern.

Lieutenant Colonel Vasco Yahari had served in the 17th army, not as an academy graduate, but as a soldier who worked his way up through the system, which considered as 2nd tier army personel. He’d retired two years ago, disillusioned by the elite academy officers from Radit’s Peak, who controlled the top brass and blocked his advancement. Vasco had joined the army through national service, not the prestigious military channels, and though he’d risen as far as he could, the door to further promotion had always been closed to him.

Ivor respected his father deeply but didn’t share his cynicism. Vasco’s bitter remarks—“The Republic is like a house built on swamp mud; the surface looks fine until you see what’s underneath”—nagged at the back of Ivor’s mind. To Ivor, those were the words of a man who’d given up.

Yes, the Republic had flaws. Yes, change came slowly. But Ivor believed in the system. The government’s methods, however opaque, would serve the greater good in the end. Somebody just needed to believe—and that somebody would be him.

“Ivor! Breakfast’s ready!” his mother’s voice echoed again from downstairs.

“Coming!” he called, slinging his worn school bag over his shoulder.

Downstairs, Karina Yahari stood by the stove, her sleeves rolled up, ladling boiled eggs onto a chipped plate. The tiny kitchen smelled of fried plantains and old cooking oil, the usual morning aroma. Her hands were rough from years of stocking shelves and carrying crates at their small grocery store.

She gave Ivor a tired smile as he sat at the small table. “Another big day?” she asked, pouring him a cup of tea that was more water than leaves.

“Yeah,” Ivor said, buttering a piece of stale bread. “The final debate’s today. We’re arguing about the government’s economic policies.” He grinned. “I’ve got it in the bag.”

Karina’s smile wavered for a moment, and she glanced toward the empty chair at the head of the table—Vasco’s spot, untouched since his quiet retirement. Ivor noticed but said nothing. His father preferred to take his breakfasts outside, in the garden, tending to his vegetable patch and letting the silence speak for him.

“You know,” Karina said carefully, “sometimes winning isn’t everything.”

Ivor frowned. “What do you mean?”

She hesitated, choosing her words. “Just... don’t be too hard on yourself if things don’t go the way you expect.”

Ivor gave her a reassuring smile, though inside he felt annoyed. She didn’t understand. “I’ve got this, Mom. Trust me.”

His mother nodded absently, but Ivor could see the doubt lingering in her eyes—the same quiet resignation that seemed to grip all the adults in Libre, as if they’d come to terms with a truth Ivor refused to accept.

The streets of Libre were alive with noise despite the early hour. Street vendors lined the sidewalks, shouting their wares—fried fish, rice balls, cheap trinkets. The buzz of motorbikes cut through the air, narrowly missing pedestrians. The sharp scent of burning wood from a nearby forge mixed with the ever-present odor of mud and stagnant water.

Ivor passed a group of hungover men sprawled across the sidewalk, their clothes stained and their faces slack. He wrinkled his nose in disgust.

“Idiots,” he muttered under his breath. “This city would be better off without them.”

As he reached the canal bridge, he spotted Tariq Imran and Felix Voss waiting for him.

Tariq, with his unkempt hair and ink-stained fingers, gave a lazy wave. “You ready to crush that debate, or what?” He chewed on a sugar cane stick, grinning as if life were a game to him.

“Already won it in my head,” Ivor said confidently.

Felix, tall and broad-shouldered, gave a slow chuckle. “You know the others are gonna hate you for making them look stupid, right?”

“That’s the plan,” Ivor replied with a smirk.

As they crossed the bridge together, Lina William caught up to them, her auburn hair glinting in the sunlight. She slipped her hand into Ivor’s without a word, her touch grounding him.

“Nervous?” she asked softly.

“Not really,” Ivor lied, squeezing her hand. “It’s just a debate.”

Lina smiled knowingly. “You always say that before big things.”

Tariq groaned dramatically. “Ugh. They’re being cute again. Someone make it stop.”

“Jealous?” Lina teased, flashing a playful grin.

“Jealous of public embarrassment? Definitely.”

Felix gave Tariq a friendly shove. “Come on, man. Let them have their moment.”

The high school building loomed before them, its faded walls streaked with grime and its windows clouded with dust. Inside, the walls were plastered with patriotic posters promoting unity and discipline, though most students treated them with indifference.

In the stuffy classroom where the debate took place, Ivor’s team gathered around their table. The topic was: “Does the Government’s Economic Policy Serve Long-term National Interest?”

Ivor attacked every argument with sharp precision, his voice steady and sure. He believed in his position with all his heart—the government’s policies, though imperfect, always worked toward a greater goal. His opponents faltered, their points crumbling under his relentless logic.

When the debate ended, Ivor leaned back in his chair, triumphant.

Later, as the school bell rang and students spilled out into the streets, Lina walked beside Ivor, swinging his hand gently in hers.

“You did good today,” she said softly.

“Of course I did,” Ivor replied, though some part of him felt strangely hollow.

Tariq and Felix caught up, still teasing and bantering as they strolled through the noisy streets. This was their world—a forgotten corner of the Republic, but for now, it was enough.

And soon, Ivor knew, he would leave it behind. Adventure awaited—a city of opportunity, where he would finally find his place.

At least that what he think.
