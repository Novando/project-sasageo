# Chapter 10: The Climb to Radit’s Peak

The buses rumbled to a stop at the foot of Radit Mountain, their headlights cutting through the pitch-black night. The doors hissed open, and a flood of exhausted candidates spilled out into the cold air, their breaths visible in the crisp darkness.

Ivor shivered slightly, pulling his jacket tighter around him as he stepped onto the uneven ground. The sky above was thick with stars, but the sheer black silhouette of Radit’s Peak loomed ominously in the distance. There were no signs, no maps, and no instructions—just the jagged outline of the mountain, shadowed and foreboding.

More buses arrived—one after another—offloading Air Force recruits, Army trainees, and Navy cadet candidates, forming a massive assembly of young, confused faces.

The cold air stung Ivor’s cheeks as he scanned his surroundings. Midnight had come and gone, and with it, any sense of comfort the candidates might have had. They stood at attention, bodies stiff from the long bus ride, uncertain of what to expect next.

Suddenly, the sharp sound of boots on gravel silenced the murmuring crowd. A tall figure in a dark coat stepped forward—Major Isnain Salasa, the commander of the candidate battalion. His face was set in a grim expression, his eyes cold and calculating.

“Listen carefully,” Major Salasa said, his voice cutting through the stillness like a blade. “Your first objective is simple.” He paused for effect, his gaze sweeping across the group. “Get to the top of Radit’s Peak—before sunrise.”

---

A ripple of shock and disbelief spread through the crowd. Exhausted from the journey and unfamiliar with the terrain, the candidates exchanged nervous glances.

“Wait—what peak?” one candidate whispered frantically. “Do we even know where we’re going?”

Ivor’s pulse quickened, but the order made perfect sense to him. If you wanted to survive in the military, you needed to master navigation, no matter what branch you served in. A soldier who couldn’t find their way was a liability.

Major Salasa continued without sympathy. “Each platoon must choose a commander. Pick one yourselves. If you arrive at the summit with missing members, your platoon will be disqualified.”

The major’s gaze darkened. “Act smart. Be stupid, and this mountain will kill you.”

With that, he turned on his heel and disappeared into the night, leaving the battalion stunned and leaderless.

The silence stretched thin. Candidates muttered anxiously among themselves, unsure of what to do next.

Ivor glanced around at his 4th Platoon of B Company—a group of thirty-five young men and women, all staring at each other, waiting for someone to step up. The mountain loomed silently over them, its shadow swallowing any sense of direction or clarity.

This was his moment.

Before anyone else could react, Ivor raised his hand. “I’ll take command,” he said, stepping forward confidently. His heart pounded, but he kept his voice steady. “We need someone who can make decisions now—not later.”

The group looked at each other uncertainly, but no one objected.

“Fine,” said one of the candidates with a shrug. “Lead the way, Yahari.”

As Ivor took charge, the group quickly fell into ranks. Three figures stood out among the platoon, each with their own presence and energy:

    Rafiq “Raf” Husseini – A lean, quiet young man with a sharp mind. He carried himself with the calm demeanor of someone who observed more than he spoke. Raf had a natural talent for reading situations, and although he didn’t openly challenge Ivor’s leadership, his skeptical gaze suggested he wasn’t fully convinced.

    Talia Morel – A broad-shouldered and athletic woman with a no-nonsense attitude. Talia’s background in competitive sports made her fiercely determined, and she immediately gravitated toward Ivor’s leadership. She didn’t care who led—as long as they could get the job done.

    Eren Klaus – A slender young man with a nervous energy, constantly adjusting his glasses. Eren was a bit of an outsider—awkward but insightful. His instincts for detail were sharp, but his lack of confidence often held him back.

“Alright, Yahari. What’s the plan?” Talia asked bluntly, her breath puffing out in clouds of white vapor.

Ivor squared his shoulders, already scanning the horizon. “We keep it simple.” He pointed toward the dark outline of the peak far above them. “We move together, in a straight line. No stragglers. If someone slows down, we carry them.”

Raf crossed his arms, his expression skeptical. “You do realize we can’t see shit, right? What if we get lost?”

“We won’t,” Ivor said confidently, holding up his compass. “I know how to navigate. Follow me, and we’ll make it.”

With Ivor leading the way, the platoon began the grueling ascent toward Radit’s Peak. The cold wind whipped against their faces as they trudged through the dark forest at the mountain’s base, their boots crunching on rocks and dried leaves.

For the first hour, the climb was steady but manageable. Ivor kept his compass pointed north, using the stars as additional reference points. The group followed in silence, the only sound being their labored breathing and the occasional stumble on loose rocks.

But as the climb grew steeper, the exhaustion set in.

Eren tripped over a root and fell face-first into the dirt, groaning. “We’re never going to make it.”

Talia hauled him to his feet. “Get up, Klaus. No one’s getting left behind.”

Raf shot Ivor a sideways glance. “We’re burning energy too fast, Yahari. We need to rest, or people are going to start dropping.”

“We can’t stop,” Ivor snapped. “If we fall behind, we’re out. Keep moving.”

---

The final stretch was brutal—the air thinner, the ground more treacherous. Loose rocks slipped beneath their boots, and the wind howled through the cliffs, freezing their fingers and faces.

Eren staggered again, gasping for air. Talia grabbed his arm, practically dragging him up the slope. “Come on, we’re almost there.”

Raf muttered under his breath but kept moving, matching Ivor’s pace. Despite the challenges, Ivor refused to stop. His legs ached, his lungs burned, but he knew they had no choice—they had to reach the summit before sunrise.

---

As the first light of dawn began to creep over the horizon, Ivor’s platoon stumbled onto the summit.

They had made it.

Panting and exhausted, the platoon members collapsed to the ground, but a sense of triumph filled the air.

“We did it, Yahari,” Talia said, clapping Ivor on the shoulder.

Raf gave a grudging nod. “Not bad, Yahari. Maybe you do know what you’re doing.”

Eren, still catching his breath, managed a weak smile. “Glad you were in charge.”

As the company commanders arrived to check their progress, the platoon stood tall once more. Every member was accounted for. The company commander gave Ivor an approving nod, officially designating him as the permanent platoon commander.

Ivor’s chest swelled with pride. He had done it. He had led them through the night, against all odds.

For the first time, he felt like a true leader. And it tasted like victory.
