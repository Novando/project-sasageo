# Chapter 11: Three Months at Radit’s Peak

On the morning after their grueling climb, Ivor's 4th Platoon awoke to the sound of a deafening whistle blast. The barracks door burst open, and an NCO in a red cap stormed in, rifle slung across his back.

“UP, YOU WORMS!” he bellowed. “Formation at the courtyard—NOW! MOVE IT!”

The platoon stumbled out of their bunks, scrambling to get dressed, barely awake and still aching from the climb. Ivor barked orders to his squadmates, trying to keep things organized.

“Get your boots on! Let’s go!” he snapped. Eren fumbled with his laces, but Ivor grabbed him by the shoulder and yanked him upright. “You’re not slowing us down, Klaus!”

Outside, the freezing air bit into their faces, and the new cadets assembled as quickly as they could. From across the courtyard, Major Salasa stood with his hands behind his back, surveying the chaotic scene with a look of mild disgust. Behind him, Nolan Veltras and his 1st Platoon stood already in perfect formation, their expressions calm and focused.

“This is the difference between excellence and mediocrity,” Salasa said, gesturing toward Nolan’s group. “If you want to survive here, you’ll need to figure out which one you want to be.”

Ivor gritted his teeth, glaring toward Nolan and his so-called "aces." He was determined to prove his platoon could match them.

Life at Radit’s Peak quickly settled into a brutal rhythm. Each day began with a five-kilometer run before dawn, followed by hours of weapons training, obstacle courses, and tactical exercises. The cadets barely had time to eat or rest before being thrown into another round of drills.

For Ivor, Raf, Talia, and Eren, the biggest challenge was learning to work together despite their different personalities and backgrounds.

    Raf Husseini (Air Force): Calm and methodical, Raf excelled at tasks requiring precision and foresight. However, his tendency to overanalyze sometimes frustrated Ivor.
    Talia Morel (Army): Fiercely competitive, Talia pushed herself—and everyone around her—to their limits. She was relentless but lacked patience for slower members of the team, especially Eren.
    Eren Klaus (Navy): Though awkward and clumsy at first, Eren slowly found his rhythm during the theory classes on strategy and navigation. He was the most loyal to Ivor but often needed encouragement to keep up physically.

The training regimen pushed them to their breaking points, but Ivor thrived on the challenge. He led from the front, setting the pace during long runs and keeping his team focused during live-fire exercises. Failure wasn’t an option for him, and he made sure everyone knew it.

Throughout the three months, Ivor’s rivalry with Nolan Veltras simmered beneath the surface. Nolan, commanding the elite 1st Platoon of A Company, always seemed one step ahead—his platoon never faltered, never missed a mark.

During joint exercises, Ivor watched in frustration as Nolan’s team completed tasks with cold efficiency. While Ivor struggled to keep Eren and Talia in sync, Nolan’s platoon moved like a well-oiled machine.

“Don’t get too comfortable, Yahari,” Nolan told him one afternoon, his tone light but condescending. “Your platoon still has a long way to go.”

Ivor bit back a retort, determined to outshine Nolan no matter what it took. 4th Platoon would be recognized—they had to be.

But there was another presence that haunted Ivor’s thoughts—Mikael Otoapedi.

Despite Ivor’s belief that Mikael would wash out, the strange cadet continued to survive. During every drill, Mikael barely scraped by, finishing last but never failing.

Mikael’s presence gnawed at Ivor, and every time their eyes met, Mikael wore that same calm, knowing smile.

“He’s mocking me,” Ivor thought bitterly, his frustration growing with each encounter.

One of the most challenging moments came during a night navigation exercise, where each platoon had to find their way through the dense forest with nothing but compasses and a limited supply of flares.

Ivor’s platoon moved in silence, their footsteps crunching on dead leaves. Raf and Talia took point, navigating through the uneven terrain while Ivor kept the group together from the rear.

After hours of trekking, Eren stumbled again, falling to his knees in exhaustion.

“Get up, Klaus!” Talia hissed. “We’re not leaving you behind.”

Ivor knelt beside Eren, grabbing him by the collar. “You can do this, Eren. You’re part of this platoon. No one gets left behind—understand?”

Eren nodded weakly, forcing himself back to his feet. The group pressed on, gritting their teeth against the cold and fatigue.

By the time they reached the objective—a marked checkpoint deep in the forest—they were the third platoon to arrive. Nolan’s platoon had, of course, arrived first. But Ivor’s 4th Platoon had beaten several others, earning them a rare nod of approval from the instructors.

As the weeks passed, the bonds between Ivor, Raf, Talia, and Eren began to solidify. They learned each other’s strengths and weaknesses, compensating for one another during drills and exercises.

    Raf became Ivor’s go-to for tactical advice. His calm, logical thinking helped them avoid pitfalls during strategy sessions.
    Talia pushed the group physically, ensuring no one fell behind during endurance challenges.
    Eren, despite his struggles, proved invaluable in theory lessons and complex problem-solving tasks. His quiet loyalty to Ivor didn’t go unnoticed.

One evening, after a particularly grueling day of training, the four of them sat together around a small campfire, sharing quiet conversation. For the first time, they felt like a real team—a unit that could face anything Radit’s Peak threw at them.

“We’ll get through this,” Ivor said confidently, staring into the flickering flames. “We’re going to be the best.”

At the end of the three months, Major Salasa conducted a final inspection, his sharp eyes scanning each platoon with cold precision.

When he reached Ivor’s platoon, the major gave a brief nod. “You’ve improved.”

Ivor felt a surge of pride as the platoon stood tall in formation. They had survived the worst Radit’s Peak could offer, and Ivor’s leadership had earned them respect—even from their skeptical peers.

As the inspection ended, Nolan Veltras approached Ivor with a sly grin. “Not bad, Yahari. Let’s see if you can keep it up.”

Ivor met his gaze, his determination burning brighter than ever. “I will.”
