# Chapter 12: The Closing Ceremony and the War Game

As the final day at Radit’s Peak arrived, the cadet candidates gathered in the courtyard of the mountain base, standing at attention under the clear, cold sky. Major Isnain Salasa stood at the front of the battalion, his sharp eyes scanning the ranks.

“Three months at Radit’s Peak.” His voice was steady, cold, and without emotion. “Some of you arrived here as spoiled children. Some of you thought you knew what it meant to serve.” He paused, letting the silence stretch uncomfortably. “Most of you were wrong.”

A ripple of unease spread through the candidates, though none dared move.

“But you survived,” Salasa continued. “You endured. The weak are gone, and only the worthy remain.” He paced slowly in front of the formation. “Tomorrow, you will return to your respective branches—the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. But before you leave...”

Salasa stopped, turning to face the battalion. A rare smile curved his lips.

“We’ll see if any of you learned anything.”

---

The major gestured to a map of the training zone, displayed on a projector screen for all to see.
“Your final exercise will be a battle royale—a war game to test everything you’ve learned. It will take place across five square kilometers of forest and terrain on the south side of Radit’s Peak.”

The cadets murmured quietly among themselves, excitement and nerves bubbling under the surface.

“The game will consist of two platoons: the 1st Platoon of A Company and the 4th Platoon of B Company. The objective is simple: eliminate your opponent completely.”

Salasa let the weight of the words sink in before continuing.
“Victory is achieved by capturing or incapacitating every member of the opposing platoon. Each team will be issued simulated rifles and ammunition. You’ll feel the hits when you’re tagged—don’t make me remind you that it’ll hurt like hell. But there will be no injuries recorded unless you’re careless.”

The major’s eyes narrowed. “Be smart, or be eliminated.”

He let the announcement hang in the air for a moment longer before giving a final smirk.
“4th Platoon—you have been marked as the most improved platoon of this cycle.”

Ivor felt a flicker of pride rise in his chest, but he kept his face neutral.

“1st Platoon—tradition speaks for itself.” Salasa turned toward Nolan Veltras, whose expression was calm but focused. “Your platoon holds the record for unbroken victories. Make sure it stays that way.”

The crowd buzzed with excitement as the rules became clear: Ivor’s underdogs against Nolan’s aces, in a battle that would test everything they had learned over the past three months.

Raf leaned in close to Ivor, whispering with a smirk.
“Looks like we’re in for a fight.”

The next morning, the two platoons stood opposite each other at the forest’s edge, preparing for battle. Simulated rifles—which fired impact rounds—rested in their hands. Their faces were smeared with camouflage paint, their breathing steady but tense.

“Alright,” Ivor began, tapping the map with his finger. “We need to outsmart Nolan. Direct confrontation won’t work. His guys are too fast and too coordinated.”

Talia nodded, her eyes sharp. “So what’s the plan?”

“We split into four squads,” Ivor said. “Each of us will lead one. Raf takes Squad One—you’re in charge of flanking. Talia, you’ll run interference with Squad Two. Draw their attention, slow them down.”

“Got it,” Talia said, already itching to move.

“Eren, you’ll control Squad Three. Stay hidden. When things get messy, you’ll hit them from behind.” Ivor shot him a reassuring nod. “You’ve got this.”

Eren swallowed nervously but nodded. “Yeah. I’ll make it work.”

“And I’ll lead Squad Four,” Ivor continued. “We’ll act as bait—get Nolan’s attention and draw him into an ambush. If we can isolate him, we’ve got a shot.”

Raf raised an eyebrow. “You really think Nolan’s going to fall for that?”

Ivor smirked. “If he doesn’t, we lose. If he does... we win. Simple as that.”

A loud whistle pierced the air. The game had begun.

---

The cadets marched into the thick forest, their boots crunching on dead leaves and gravel. A cold wind swept through the trees, sharp and unforgiving.

Each squad broke off from the main group, moving silently through the undergrowth. Raf’s team moved along the eastern edge, circling wide to flank their opponents. Talia’s squad positioned themselves deeper in the forest, ready to create a diversion. Eren’s group remained hidden, waiting to spring an ambush.

Ivor, leading Squad Four, moved confidently toward the center of the forest—exactly where he knew Nolan’s team would expect them.

“Keep quiet,” Ivor whispered to his squadmates, scanning the treeline. “They’re coming. Stay sharp.”

---

The first attack came faster than expected. Nolan’s team hit Raf’s squad like a hammer, emerging from the shadows with flawless precision. Shots rang out—three cadets from Raf’s group went down in seconds.

“Move, move!” Raf hissed, pulling his remaining teammates into cover. But it was too late—Nolan’s team was already on the move, pressing their advantage with brutal efficiency.

Through the chaos, Nolan himself emerged, cool and collected, his rifle snapping off perfect shots. In a matter of minutes, he had eliminated ten cadets across two different squads.

“Damn it, he’s fast,” Raf muttered, retreating with his remaining team members.

---

As Nolan’s team pursued Raf, Talia’s squad sprang into action. They fired a volley of shots, forcing Nolan’s team into cover and disrupting their advance.

“Fall back! Get ready for the ambush!” Talia shouted, leading her team deeper into the forest.

Meanwhile, Eren’s squad struck from behind, firing carefully aimed shots that took out two of Nolan’s cadets. For the first time, the 1st Platoon faltered—their tight formation breaking under pressure.

“Now! Move!” Ivor yelled, leading Squad Four into the fray. They fired relentlessly, picking off Nolan’s remaining teammates one by one.

---

In the final moments of the game, only five cadets remained standing—Nolan from 1st Platoon, and Ivor, Raf, Talia, and Eren from 4th Platoon. The forest was eerily silent except for their labored breathing.

“It’s over, Veltras,” Ivor called out, keeping his rifle steady.

Nolan emerged slowly from the shadows, his rifle still raised. Despite being outnumbered, his expression was calm.

“You fought well, Yahari,” Nolan said, his voice steady. “But let’s see if you can finish it.”

The final exchange was brutal. Talia fired first, but Nolan dodged and took her out with a precise shot. Raf retaliated, but Nolan moved like a ghost, tagging Raf before he could fire.

It was down to Ivor and Eren against Nolan.

“Now, Klaus!” Ivor shouted.

Eren stepped forward, firing a perfect shot that hit Nolan square in the chest.

The whistle blew, signaling the end of the game.

They had won.

---

The forest was filled with stunned silence as the two platoons gathered at the clearing. Nolan sat on the ground, stunned but smiling. He gave Ivor a respectful nod.

“You earned this one, Yahari,” Nolan said. “But don’t get too comfortable. Next time, I’ll win.”

Ivor grinned, his chest swelling with pride.

---

When the platoons returned to the base, Major Salasa stood waiting. His expression was unreadable, but as the cadets lined up in formation, he stepped forward with a small box in hand.

“Only four times in the history of this battalion has the ace platoon been defeated,” Salasa said. “Today is one of those occasions.”

He opened the box, revealing the Radit’s Peak Conqueror Medals.

“To the 4th Platoon of B Company,” the major said, pinning a medal on Ivor’s chest. “You’ve earned this.”

---

After the ceremony, the members of 4th Platoon gathered in a tight circle. One by one, they saluted Ivor, their new leader.

“We follow you, Yahari. Wherever you go.”

Ivor’s heart swelled. This was the moment he had dreamed of—respect, recognition, and loyalty.

He had proven himself. And he was just getting started.
