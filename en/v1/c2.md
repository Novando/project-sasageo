# Chapter 2: “The Threshold of Arrogance”

The classroom was suffused with the quiet hum of anxious students, all hunched over their papers as the final exam period drew to a close. The oppressive heat of the swamp seeped into the room, making sweat bead on foreheads and pages curl at the edges. Ivor Yahari sat at his desk near the front, his pen gliding across the answer sheet with unwavering confidence. He glanced at the clock—fifteen minutes left, but he had already finished.

He allowed himself a satisfied smirk, tapping his pen against the desk. His answers were flawless, as always. The Republic rewarded effort and intelligence, and Ivor believed himself to be both.

A few desks away, Tariq Imran scratched his head furiously, erasing answers only to rewrite them moments later. His messy notes reflected his scattered thoughts, and the anxiety on his face was obvious. Across the aisle, Felix Voss looked equally tense, gripping his pen so hard his knuckles whitened.

Ivor noticed their struggle but dismissed it. If they had studied more, they wouldn’t be having these problems.

The bell rang.

“Pens down!” the teacher barked.

Chairs scraped against the floor as students handed in their exam sheets. Ivor strolled up to the front of the class with the relaxed stride of someone who knew he’d aced it. Behind him, Tariq groaned softly, rubbing his temples.

“That... was horrible,” Tariq muttered as they left the classroom.

“You’ll be fine,” Ivor said, waving him off. “You stress too much.”

Tariq gave him a side glance, a flicker of doubt crossing his face. “I hope so.”

Felix trudged alongside them, silent for once. Normally, he was the steady one, but today even Felix seemed rattled. “Some of those questions weren’t on the syllabus,” he mumbled. “They threw curveballs.”

Ivor shrugged. “Not my fault if you guys didn’t prepare properly.” His tone was light, but the words stung.

The three friends headed to the school’s outdoor courtyard, where other students were gathered, sharing either nervous laughs or sighs of defeat. The thick swamp air felt heavier than usual, hanging over the group like a wet blanket.

Felix leaned against a tree, arms folded. “This whole system’s rigged. Some people are gonna fail no matter what.”

“You’re being dramatic,” Ivor said dismissively. “If you do the work, you pass. Simple as that.”

Felix scowled. “You really believe that, don’t you?”

“Yes,” Ivor shot back, crossing his arms. “And I’ll prove it when I join Gaya Maeda.”

Tariq’s eyes widened. “The naval academy!? Are you serious!?”

Ivor straightened his back, as if daring them to question him. “I’m going to be more than just a soldier. You see, Navy is the most prestegious unit in the republic, the goverment dominated by navy veterans. It's My path to became a decision-maker. Someone who can actually change things. No more deadweight like those drunk idiots on the streets.”

Tariq’s expression darkened. “You can’t just—”

“I can,” Ivor cut him off, his voice hard. “And I will.”

The tension grew thick between them.

Felix pushed off the tree, stepping closer to Ivor. “What the hell’s gotten into you? You sound like you want to wipe people out just because they don’t meet your standards.”

Ivor’s gaze hardened. “Maybe I do.”

Felix’s jaw clenched. “You’re starting to sound like one of those academy brats you hate so much. You think you’re better than everyone?”

“I am better,” Ivor snapped, stepping forward. His fists tightened at his sides. “And soon, I’ll be in a position to prove it.”

Felix’s face twisted with anger, and for a moment, it seemed like the two might come to blows. Tariq quickly stepped between them, raising his hands.

“Hey, hey! Calm down! Both of you!” Tariq said, glancing nervously between them. “This isn’t worth it.”

But neither Ivor nor Felix backed down immediately. They stood inches apart, their eyes locked in a silent battle of wills. Finally, Felix muttered a curse under his breath and turned away, shoving his hands into his pockets.

“This isn’t you, Ivor,” Felix said over his shoulder. “You’re just too stubborn to see it.”

The conflict between the three friends left an uncomfortable silence lingering in the air. The bonds they’d shared were beginning to fray, stretched thin by Ivor’s growing arrogance and his desire for power. Tariq and Felix still stuck around, but things were no longer the same. Conversations became stilted. Jokes felt forced.

Even Lina William noticed the shift, though she stayed by Ivor’s side, hoping things would smooth over with time.

At their graduation ceremony, Ivor made his plans known to everyone.

“I’m going to join Gaya Maeda,” he declared, standing tall among his peers. “One day, I’ll rise to the top. And when I do, I’ll make sure only those who deserve to stay in places like Libre remain. The rest? They’ll be dealt with.”

His words were met with a mixture of stunned silence and uneasy murmurs. Tariq shot Felix a glance, but Felix only shook his head, jaw tight with frustration. Lina’s expression flickered with uncertainty, but she stayed quiet, holding onto Ivor’s arm.

Ivor didn’t care what the others thought. He had a vision for the future—a future where he would decide who belonged and who didn’t.

The day of Ivor’s departure arrived with a cloudy sky and a cold drizzle, unusual for Libre. At the airport, the atmosphere was thick with unspoken emotions.

Tariq, Felix, Lina, and Ivor stood together near the departure gate, surrounded by the bustle of travelers and the hum of announcements over the loudspeaker.

Felix’s anger from before seemed to have faded into reluctant acceptance. He reached out a hand. “Good luck in Kroko, man.”

Ivor hesitated for a moment but took the hand. “Thanks. No hard feelings?”

Felix gave him a tight-lipped smile. “We’re good. Just... don’t forget where you came from, yeah?”

Tariq clapped Ivor on the shoulder. “You’re still an idiot, but we’ll miss you.”

Ivor chuckled. “I’ll miss you guys too.”

For a moment, it felt like things might be okay between them. But just as Ivor turned toward the terminal entrance, Felix’s voice stopped him.

“Hey, Ivor.”

Ivor glanced over his shoulder.

Felix’s eyes were serious, his voice low. “Remember what you said on graduation day? About getting rid of the people who don’t belong?”

Ivor raised an eyebrow. “What about it?”

Felix’s expression darkened. “Don’t become the thing you hate.”

For a moment, their gazes locked—two friends standing at a crossroads, knowing that the path ahead might take them in opposite directions.

Ivor gave a small, dismissive smirk. “I’m just doing what’s necessary.”

Without another word, he turned and entered the terminal, leaving Tariq, Felix, and Lina standing in silence.

The friendship they had shared was now a fractured memory, and though Ivor didn’t know it yet, his journey had already begun to change him.

He just didn’t know yet how much that journey would change him.
