# Chapter 3: Arrival in The Dreamland

The wheels of the aircraft squealed as it touched down on the runway of Kroko International Airport, built on a vast artificial island that jutted out into the turquoise waters. Through the small airplane window, Ivor Yahari pressed his forehead against the glass, his breath fogging the pane as he stared at the glimmering cityscape in the distance.

The airport terminal, shaped like a sleek crescent moon, sparkled under the morning sun. Its glass walls gleamed, reflecting the sea, and enormous aircraft moved gracefully across the runway, like birds migrating between worlds. Ivor could barely contain his excitement as the plane taxied toward the terminal.

“This,” he whispered to himself, “is where everything begins.”

Disembarking the plane, he stepped into the cool, air-conditioned terminal, filled with rows of luxury boutiques, tech displays, and high-end cafés. It felt like stepping into another world—one that was the complete opposite of the damp, decaying streets of Libre.

His worn shoes squeaked faintly against the glossy marble floors as he walked toward the baggage claim, surrounded by passengers dressed in expensive suits, flowing dresses, and military uniforms with gleaming medals pinned to their chests. For the first time in his life, Ivor felt like he was exactly where he belonged.

As Ivor collected his bag, he followed the flow of passengers toward the airport’s main exit. Outside, the city of Kroko sprawled out in all directions, rising like a colossus of glass and steel. Monorails zipped past overhead, weaving between towering skyscrapers, while sleek ferries glided across the harbor waters far below.

And then Ivor saw it—a warship.

Not just any warship, but one of the Republic’s latest naval destroyers, docked near the island’s military pier. The vessel’s sleek gray hull reflected the sunlight, and its massive radar tower stood like a sentinel against the bright blue sky.

Ivor stopped in his tracks, his heart pounding. He had seen pictures of warships in books and television, but nothing could have prepared him for seeing one in person. It was... perfect.

“Magnificent,” he whispered, feeling a thrill run down his spine.

In that moment, all his doubts and frustrations melted away. This was what he wanted. Power. Order. Purpose. This was what it meant to be a part of something greater than himself. He wasn’t just a nobody from Libre anymore—he was on his way to becoming someone who mattered.

He stood on the pedestrian walkway for a moment longer, reverently admiring the ship. A satisfied smile tugged at his lips as the wind from the harbor ruffled his hair.

“Soon,” he whispered, his gaze fixed on the destroyer. “Soon, I’ll have a place among them.”

Ivor’s excitement surged as he left the airport and entered the main city. The roads were smooth, lined with sleek electric trams and futuristic traffic lights. Every building sparkled as if freshly cleaned. The people on the streets—most of them sharply dressed—moved with purpose, their expressions focused. The air even smelled different—cleaner, sharper, and laced with the faint aroma of perfume and new leather.

As he approached the city center, a group of homeless men huddled near a graffiti-covered alley caught his attention. Their clothes were torn, and their faces were drawn with hunger and exhaustion. One of the men held out a hand, his voice hoarse.

“Spare a coin, sir?” the man muttered.

Ivor stopped, a sneer curling his lips. “Get a job,” he spat, his voice dripping with disdain.

The man shrank back, but Ivor wasn’t done. His earlier excitement—the sight of the warship, the grandeur of the city—had bloated his arrogance. He felt invincible, like everything in this place was built for people like him. People who deserved it.

“You’re only here because you’re too incompetent to be anywhere else,” Ivor muttered under his breath.

He kept walking, brushing past the men as if they were no more than annoying insects buzzing in his path.

This was Kroko. A place for the capable and the ambitious. There was no room for the weak or the useless here—just as there shouldn’t be any room for them anywhere in the Republic.

Kroko was more than Ivor ever imagined. For days, he wandered through its wide streets, marveling at every aspect of the city. The parks were perfectly manicured, with fountains that danced to music. Massive shopping districts displayed the latest technology, from electric motorcycles to augmented reality glasses. Cafés spilled out onto sunlit sidewalks, filled with politicians, entrepreneurs, and military officers engaged in lively conversation.

The public transportation system ran like clockwork, with monorails and trams arriving at stations to the second. The people here weren’t just living—they were thriving. This was what a city should be.

At night, the harbor glittered with lights from ferries, cargo ships, and sleek naval vessels, their silhouettes stark against the moonlit water. Ivor’s heart soared every time he caught a glimpse of the warships patrolling the harbor, knowing that soon, he would be part of their world.
Scene 5: Gaya Maeda – The Naval Academy of His Dreams

Two weeks after arriving in Kroko, Ivor stood before the gates of Gaya Maeda Naval Academy. The massive iron gates, adorned with the Republic’s crest, opened into a sprawling campus lined with marble statues and high-tech facilities.

Ivor stared in awe. He had imagined the academy would be impressive, but this was beyond anything he could have dreamed.

The buildings gleamed with white stone and mirrored glass, surrounded by perfectly landscaped gardens. Students in crisp uniforms moved purposefully between classes, their expressions sharp and focused. Even the air felt different here—cleaner, sharper, filled with the energy of ambition.

Ivor took a deep breath, standing at the entrance with his admission forms in hand. This was it. This was where everything would begin.

The admission office was a sleek, modern building at the center of the campus. Ivor entered, heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and nerves. Inside, administrative staff moved briskly, checking paperwork and guiding applicants through the registration process.

The admission line snaked through the lobby, filled with other young hopefuls—some nervous, others as confident as Ivor.

His hands tightened around the forms as he inched closer to the counter. His mind raced with visions of the future: graduating at the top of his class, becoming an officer, commanding his own fleet. He would rise above them all, proving once and for all that the weak had no place in the Republic.

Finally, his turn came. The admission officer looked up from her desk, her gaze cool and professional.

“Name?”

“Ivor Yahari.”

“Reason for application?”

“To become someone who matters.”, he Ivor said with steady determined voice.
