# Chapter 4: Tests of Merit

The exam hall was a long, high-ceilinged room filled with rows of wooden desks. The walls were bare, except for two large flags of the Republic hanging behind the invigilators at the front. The room smelled faintly of paper and coffee—a stale but oddly familiar scent. Ivor found his seat in the third row, glancing briefly at the other applicants filtering in around him.

A low murmur drifted through the room. Some of the students whispered quietly to each other, eyes darting anxiously around the hall, while others bent over their notes in last-minute study frenzies. But not Ivor. He was ready.

Two years of preparation, countless hours of reading naval strategy and military doctrine—he had absorbed it all. Failure wasn’t even a possibility. The weight of the Republic’s history, the chain of command, and navigation theory were already etched into his mind. The test ahead would be no more difficult than a walk through a park.

A young invigilator cleared his throat at the front of the room, drawing everyone’s attention. “The test will last two hours. No talking or leaving your seats once it begins.” His eyes swept the room before he added, “Begin.”

The soft rustle of papers filled the air as the applicants flipped over their answer sheets. Ivor scanned the first few questions and smirked to himself. They were exactly what he had expected. With quiet precision, his pen moved across the paper, filling in answer after answer.

His hand didn’t falter once. Navigation theory—done. Naval history—check. He knew every piece of government policy they asked about, every detail of military operations, as if the knowledge had been hardwired into him.

Fifteen minutes passed. Then thirty. He barely noticed. Around him, some students fidgeted nervously, erasing answers or whispering questions under their breath. Ivor glanced at them briefly, a small wave of superiority washing over him. They were struggling. He was not.

At the next desk, a boy with neat black hair caught his eye. Unlike the others, this boy wasn’t panicking. His face was calm, and he wrote slowly but steadily, as if he had calculated exactly how much time he needed. His pen strokes were methodical, his expression cool.

Ivor paused, intrigued by the boy’s composure. He glanced sideways at the name tag clipped to the boy’s shirt: Nolan Veltras.

Ivor gave his answer sheet a final scan. Perfect. Without waiting, he got up and walked to the front of the room to submit his paper—the first one to finish. As he turned to leave, Nolan looked up from his work, a slight grin tugging at the corner of his mouth.

“Fast work,” Nolan murmured, not loud enough for the invigilators to hear.

Ivor shrugged, his lips curling into a smug smile. “When you know it, you know it.”

Nolan’s grin widened, though there was a flicker of something behind his gaze—not envy, but amusement. It was as if he had already sized Ivor up, taking mental notes.

“Nolan Veltras,” he said, introducing himself with a casual nod.

“Ivor Yahari.” Ivor’s smile sharpened. “See you at the top.”

“We’ll see.” Nolan returned to his work, his tone cool and unreadable.

As Ivor walked out of the exam hall, a sense of satisfaction settled over him. His confidence soared. He had not only aced the test but also found someone worth knowing—someone who shared his ambition, or at least his composure.

For the first time in a long while, he felt like he truly belonged.

The next day, the physical exam was held on the training grounds just outside Gaya Maeda. The field was enormous, with an obstacle course winding through it, dotted with climbing walls, ropes, and barriers. Beyond the field, the towering spires of the academy loomed, shimmering in the midday heat.

Ivor adjusted his shirt, his heart beating a little faster. Physical training had never been his strong suit, but he wasn’t worried. He had done just enough—running laps around Libre, lifting weights at home, barely scraping by. His performance wouldn’t be impressive, but it would be enough to pass.

Around him, the other applicants stretched or bounced on their heels, psyching themselves up for the challenge ahead. A whistle blew, and the applicants lined up at the starting point.

The first task was a 1,500-meter run around the track. As the whistle shrieked, Ivor launched forward, keeping a steady but cautious pace. His lungs burned by the second lap, but he pressed on, focusing on his breathing. Others shot ahead of him, while some fell behind—but Ivor stayed in the middle, pacing himself to finish without collapsing.

By the end of the race, he was gasping for air, his legs throbbing. It wasn’t impressive, but it was enough.

He took a moment to catch his breath, glancing at the other applicants finishing the run. Some collapsed to the ground, others doubled over in exhaustion. A few stood tall, hardly winded.

And then, Mikael Otoapedi stumbled across the finish line. He was the last one to complete the run, his soft frame heaving with effort. His shirt clung to him with sweat, and his steps wobbled. He could barely stand upright.

Ivor raised an eyebrow. “How did someone like that even get this far?” he thought with a sneer. Mikael bent over, hands on his knees, sucking in deep, ragged breaths. It was almost pathetic to watch.

For the next task—push-ups and pull-ups—Mikael barely managed the minimum requirement, his arms trembling with every movement. By the time the obstacle course began, Mikael was a mess, struggling to climb over the walls and getting tangled in the ropes.

Ivor shook his head, wiping the sweat from his brow as he watched Mikael struggle to hoist himself over the final barrier. He finished dead last, barely scraping through the test.

“He doesn’t belong here,” Ivor thought bitterly. “They’ll never let him in.”

Around him, some of the other applicants whispered and chuckled quietly at Mikael’s performance, exchanging amused glances. Ivor felt the same smug amusement bubbling inside him, but he kept it to himself. There was no point wasting energy on someone who clearly wouldn’t last.

As the test came to an end, Ivor stretched his aching muscles, satisfaction settling in his chest. He had done enough. He wasn’t the best, but he had passed, and that was what mattered.

Mikael, however, would be out of the running soon. There was no way the academy would accept someone who had performed so poorly.

With that thought, Ivor turned away from the training field, a small, self-satisfied grin curling at the edges of his mouth. His future at Gaya Maeda was within reach. All he had to do was wait.
