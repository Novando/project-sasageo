# Chapter 5: A Dangerous Group

A warm breeze swept through the city park near the academy, rustling the leaves of the manicured trees and carrying the faint hum of distant traffic. Ivor sat on a stone bench beneath the shade of an oak tree, sipping a cold drink. Around him, his new group of friends lounged on the grass, exchanging jokes and half-serious musings about their futures at Gaya Maeda.

It had only been a few days since the tests, but Ivor already felt like he belonged here. In Kroko, everything was sharper—the ambition, the conversation, even the people. And this group was no different. They didn’t just understand the world—they were determined to shape it.

Nolan Veltras sat beside him, arms casually draped over the back of the bench, his ever-watchful eyes scanning the people passing by. Yorick Elvanis reclined on the grass, arms folded behind his head, a lazy grin plastered on his face. Meanwhile, Juno Foras flipped through a magazine, her sharp gaze glancing up now and then to make biting remarks about passersby.

At the center of the group sat Leona Kessler, talking—again—about her family.

“You wouldn’t understand,” Leona said, adjusting her position and flicking her hair dramatically over her shoulder. “My family’s legacy isn’t something you can build overnight. It takes generations to maintain something like that. The Kesslers have always served the Republic—we’ve fought in every war, held every important post.”

“Right,” Yorick drawled, chewing lazily on a blade of grass. “And now you’re here, ready to reclaim the glory of your ancestors. A real underdog story.” He gave her a sarcastic thumbs-up.

Leona glared at him. “It’s not funny. Some of us carry real responsibility. We don’t have the luxury of slacking off just because our parents own a company.”

Yorick gave a mock gasp, clutching his chest. “Oh no, she wounded me.”

The group chuckled, but Ivor noticed the way Leona’s smile faltered, her frustration bubbling beneath the surface. For all her talk about noble blood, she wasn’t as confident as she pretended to be.

“Anyway,” Juno said, closing her magazine with a snap, “heritage only gets you so far. What matters now is ability. If you don’t perform, you’re out. Simple.”

Nolan nodded, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Exactly. The Republic doesn’t care about where you come from—it cares about what you can do. The weak get discarded. The strong rise.”

Leona shot him an annoyed look. “It’s not just about being strong. Some people have the right to lead. You can’t just let anyone climb to the top.”

“That’s exactly what I’m saying,” Nolan replied smoothly. “Strength isn’t just physical—it’s knowing how to adapt, when to bend the rules, and how to take what’s yours.” His eyes gleamed as he leaned forward slightly. “That’s what real power looks like.”

Yorick laughed. “You’d know, wouldn’t you, Veltras? You’ve been playing the game since birth.”

Nolan gave a modest shrug but didn’t deny it. Ivor listened intently, drawn in by the sharp logic in Nolan’s words. This was exactly how Ivor saw the world—only the strong deserved to hold power. And strength wasn’t just about muscles—it was about ambition, intelligence, and the ability to make hard choices.

Ivor cleared his throat. “That’s why we’re all here, isn’t it? To be the ones in charge? To make the decisions?”

Juno gave him an approving glance. “Exactly. The weak are dead weight. They drag the Republic down.”

Ivor leaned back, feeling more at home with every word. “Once I’m in, I’ll make sure things change. We’ll stop propping up people who don’t deserve to be here. No more freeloaders, no more parasites.”

“Spoken like a true leader,” Yorick said with a grin, raising an imaginary glass. “Here’s to the future of the Republic—one without incompetents.”

They clinked their imaginary glasses in mock celebration, laughing as if they already held the future in their hands.

Amid the laughter, Leona shifted uncomfortably, sensing that the conversation had drifted away from her. “I just think... not everyone’s equal. Some people are born to lead, and some aren’t. It’s just how the world works.”

“Sure, sure,” Nolan said, his voice dripping with amusement. “And if your name’s not on the list next week, what does that mean? That you weren’t born to lead after all?”

Leona’s smile faltered again. “I... That won’t happen. I’ll get in.”

Yorick chuckled softly. “You sound pretty sure of yourself. Must be nice, knowing you have all those noble ancestors cheering for you.”

Leona flushed, trying to hold her composure. “You’ll see. I’m not like the others. I deserve to be here.”

Juno arched an eyebrow. “We’ll see soon enough. Words don’t mean much if your name’s not on the list.”

The tension in the air grew thick. For a moment, Leona looked like she might lash out, but she quickly masked her frustration with a stiff smile. She was starting to realize that the others weren’t impressed by her heritage—and they never would be.

Ivor observed the exchange in silence, a flicker of amusement tugging at his lips. Leona’s desperation was almost pathetic. She was so obsessed with her family’s past that she couldn’t see that it didn’t matter here. What mattered was strength, ambition, and the ability to leave the weak behind.

In this group, there was no room for nostalgia—or failure.

As the sun began to set over the city, casting long shadows across the park, Ivor felt a deep sense of satisfaction.

These people were different. They weren’t like the lazy fools back in Libre. They understood the truth: the world belonged to those willing to take it. And for the first time in his life, Ivor felt like he was exactly where he belonged.

Nolan stood and stretched, brushing off his pants. “Well, this was fun. But we’ll find out soon enough who’s really going to make it.”

Yorick grinned as he rose to his feet. “Here’s hoping we all get in. Well, most of us, anyway.”

Juno gave a small, knowing smile. “Some of us are more ready than others.” Her gaze lingered briefly on Leona, who stiffened under the weight of the unspoken jab.

Ivor stood as well, a cold smile spreading across his face. He had no doubt that his name would be on the list. The future was waiting for him—and the weak would be left behind.
