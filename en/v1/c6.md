# Chapter 6: The Night Before and the Day After

The evening air was crisp as Ivor leaned against the railing of a bridge near Gaya Maeda, gazing at the shimmering water below. The river flowed lazily beneath him, reflecting the city lights in streaks of gold and blue. He tapped a number on his phone and waited as it rang, the familiar buzz of excitement bubbling in his chest.

The line clicked.

“Ivor!” his mother’s warm voice filled the silence. “How are you, my boy? How’s Kroko?”

Ivor smiled, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “It’s... incredible. Everything’s going perfectly. I nailed both the tests, and I know tomorrow’s announcement will just confirm it.”

“Of course you did,” Karina said, her voice filled with pride. “You’ve always been our star.”

There was a brief pause, and then Vasco Yahari’s voice came through—deep and gravelly. “How are things looking, son? You think you’ve got this locked in?”

“Yeah, Dad,” Ivor replied confidently. “This is it. Once I get in, I’ll make something of myself. I’ll... I’ll fix things.”

There was a pause on the other end. “Fix things?” Vasco’s voice was cautious. “Just remember, Ivor... ambition alone isn’t enough. You need to stay grounded. This system... it’s not what it seems.”

Ivor frowned. “I know, Dad. But that’s why I want to be at the top. So I can change what’s wrong. Get rid of the dead weight.”

His father sighed—a sound heavy with experience and disappointment. “It’s easy to think like that when you’re young. Just... be careful. Don’t lose yourself chasing after power.”

Ivor bit back an annoyed retort. “I know what I’m doing, Dad. You’ll see. This is the right path.”

Karina’s voice softened the tension. “We believe in you, Ivor. Just promise us you’ll take care of yourself, alright?”

“I will,” Ivor replied, feeling a little calmer. “Oh—Mom, can you send me something from home? A... lucky charm. Something to remind me where I came from.”

Her smile was audible over the line. “Of course, sweetheart. I’ll send you something soon.”

Ivor glanced at the river again, his excitement returning. “I’ll talk to you both tomorrow after the announcement. I’ll make you proud.”

“We’re already proud of you,” Karina said softly.

“Goodnight, son,” Vasco added, his voice quieter this time.

“Goodnight,” Ivor replied before ending the call.

He stayed by the bridge for a moment longer, watching the lights flicker across the water. The future was so close, he could almost taste it.

On his way back to the apartment, Ivor noticed a familiar figure shuffling down the sidewalk—Mikael Otoapedi.

Mikael walked with his hands buried deep in his pockets, his steps slow and unhurried. The glow of a nearby streetlamp illuminated his slight frame, making his sweat-stained clothes look even more wrinkled and worn.

Ivor’s lip curled in silent disgust. “How is this guy still hanging around?”

As they passed each other, Ivor couldn’t resist sneering inwardly. Mikael’s sluggish walk, his drooping shoulders—everything about him screamed failure.

But as Ivor took a few more steps, something inside him snapped. Why should he hold back?

He turned sharply. “Hey, Otoapedi.”

Mikael stopped and turned, his expression calm and almost... amused.

Ivor crossed his arms, a cold smile spreading across his face. “Don’t get your hopes up for tomorrow. We both know you’re not getting in.”

Mikael’s lips curved into a small, knowing smile. “We’ll see.”

That smile—so infuriatingly calm and collected—made Ivor’s blood boil. For a moment, he wanted to say something cruel, to wipe that smug expression off Mikael’s face. But Mikael just gave a small shrug.

“Sorry to bother you,” Mikael said softly, his voice polite but distant. Then he turned and walked away, his slow, deliberate steps fading into the night.

Ivor stood frozen for a moment, his mind swirling with frustration. What was that smile about?

He shook his head, forcing the irritation out of his mind. It didn’t matter. Mikael would be gone by tomorrow. He was certain of it.

The next morning, the gates of Gaya Maeda Naval Academy were crowded with applicants, all waiting eagerly by the announcement board. The air buzzed with excitement and tension, the future hanging in the balance.

Ivor pushed his way through the crowd, his heart pounding. The polished gates gleamed in the morning sun, and the academy’s flag fluttered proudly above. This was it—the moment everything would fall into place.

His eyes scanned the board quickly, and there it was:

Ivor Yahari. Accepted.

A grin spread across his face. He had done it. Everything he had worked for—the late nights, the endless preparation—it had all paid off. He belonged here.

He looked further down the list.

    Nolan Veltras. Accepted.
    Juno Foras. Accepted.
    Yorick Elvanis. Accepted.

Everyone from his group had made it—except for one.

“Where’s Leona’s name?” Yorick asked, his voice thick with amusement.

Juno gave a cold, satisfied smile. “Guess her noble blood wasn’t enough.”

Ivor found himself chuckling along with the others, the betrayal feeling natural, even easy.

Leona stood frozen near the edge of the group, her face pale. “This... This can’t be right,” she whispered. “I was supposed to be on that list. My family—”

“Oh, here we go,” Yorick said, rolling his eyes. “Another speech about her legacy.”

Juno smirked. “The only legacy you’re leaving is failure.”

Nolan folded his arms, a cool smile on his face. “Better luck next year, Kessler—if you make it that far.”

Leona’s eyes filled with tears, but no one offered her sympathy. They all turned away, laughing quietly among themselves. Even Ivor felt nothing but mild amusement. She was weak, and the weak didn’t belong here.

As the group moved toward the academy gates, Ivor caught sight of someone standing quietly by the edge of the crowd.

Mikael Otoapedi.

His heart skipped a beat. Why was Mikael even here? Ivor’s mind raced. There’s no way he could have made it. Not with that disastrous performance.

But there he was—smiling.

Their eyes met across the crowd. Mikael’s smile widened, full of quiet triumph.

Panic welled up in Ivor’s chest as he pushed his way back toward the announcement board. His eyes scanned the names frantically. And then he saw it.

Mikael Otoapedi. Accepted.

Ivor’s breath caught in his throat. It didn’t make sense.

He looked back at Mikael, who gave him a small nod—the same calm, knowing smile as before.

For the first time since arriving in Kroko, Ivor felt something he couldn’t explain—a gnawing sense of unease that clung to him, refusing to let go.

How? How had someone like Mikael passed when so many others had failed?

And why did it feel like Mikael knew something Ivor didn’t?
