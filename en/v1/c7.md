# Chapter 7: Pride and Secrets

The sun beamed through the apartment window, casting long streaks of light across the floor as Ivor Yahari sat comfortably on the edge of his bed, his phone propped against a stack of books. The familiar crackle of the video call filled the room as the screen connected to his parents’ living room in Libre. Karina Yahari’s warm smile appeared first, followed by Vasco, who sat a bit further back, his arms crossed.

“Mom! Dad!” Ivor greeted them with excitement. “I did it! I’m in—I’ve officially been accepted into Gaya Maeda.”

Karina’s eyes sparkled with pride. “Oh, Ivor, that’s wonderful! We’re so proud of you.” Her voice trembled with joy, and she clapped her hands together.

Even Vasco allowed a rare smile, nodding approvingly. “Well done, son. You’ve earned it.”

Ivor’s chest swelled with pride. This was the moment he had dreamed of—validation from his parents, proof that he had climbed out of the swampy streets of Libre and into a life of significance. He belonged to something bigger now.

“This is just the first step,” Ivor said confidently. “Before long, I’ll be at the top—an officer, a leader, someone who makes real decisions. And I’ll make sure only those who deserve it rise with me.”

Karina’s eyes gleamed with pride, though Vasco’s expression hardened slightly.

“Listen to me, Ivor,” Vasco said in a measured tone. “The Republic might tell you that being strong means pushing others down, but that’s not what real leadership is.” His gaze sharpened. “The strong exist to protect the weak—not crush them. That’s the value you must keep.”

Ivor felt irritation rise, though he tried not to show it. His father’s old-fashioned ideals had always clashed with his own ambition.

“Dad, I know—”

“No, listen, Ivor.” Vasco leaned forward, his voice low and serious. “Don’t become the kind of man who believes power is for stepping on others. And ignore whatever stories you hear about Libre while you’re at the academy. You can’t trust everything they’ll tell you.”

Ivor frowned. “What do you mean? What’s going on in Libre?”

Just as Vasco was about to answer, two familiar figures stepped into the frame—Thariq and Lina.

The both sat uneasily at the edge of the Yahari family’s couch, exchanging uncomfortable glances. Their expressions were tight with worry, as if they had been holding something back.

“Hey, Ivor,” Thariq greeted awkwardly, waving at the camera. Lina gave him a small, tense smile.

“What are you guys doing at my parents' place?” Ivor asked, surprised.

“We, uh...” Thariq glanced at Vasco, his expression hesitant. “We thought it’d be better to talk to you while we’re here.”

Something about the way they both shifted nervously made Ivor’s stomach twist.

“There’s something you should know, Ivor,” Thariq began slowly. “About what’s happening in Libre. It’s been... all over the news.”

Lina leaned forward, her voice low. “The government declared martial law here. They sent a full brigade of soldiers to lock down the city.”

Ivor blinked, stunned. “Martial law? Why? What the hell is going on?”

“They’re saying it’s for security reasons,” Lina muttered, her expression grim. “But... people are scared, Ivor. It doesn’t feel like it’s about security at all.”

Before they could say more, Karina Yahari abruptly cut in.

“That’s enough, both of you!” she said sharply, waving her hand as if to dismiss the topic entirely. Her smile turned tense, almost forced. “Ivor doesn’t need to be worrying about this now. He has his future to focus on.”

“Mom, wait—” Ivor started, but Karina continued in a rushed tone.

“Really, sweetheart, it’s nothing you need to think about. Just focus on your studies, okay? This is your moment—don’t get distracted by what’s happening back here.”

Vasco gave her a sidelong glance, his jaw tightening, but he didn’t say anything.

“You can’t ignore this forever, Karina,” Thariq muttered under his breath.

But Karina shot them both a warning look, and they fell silent. She turned back to the camera with a tight smile. “Alright, Ivor, we’ll talk again soon. Okay? Take care of yourself.”

Before Ivor could protest, the call ended abruptly. The screen went black.

Ivor sat in stunned silence, his mind racing. Martial law? A whole brigade? Why hadn’t his parents told him anything earlier? Why had his mother cut off the conversation so suddenly? And what were Thariq and Lina trying to warn him about?

He drummed his fingers on the bed, feeling a flicker of frustration. What wasn’t he being told? His father’s advice echoed in his mind:

“Ignore what they tell you about Libre. You can’t trust everything.”

A gnawing sense of unease crept into his thoughts, but Ivor shook his head firmly. It didn’t matter. Whatever was happening in Libre had nothing to do with him.

“Focus on the future,” he told himself. “The academy is what matters.”

---

Over the next few days, Ivor pushed all thoughts of Libre and the troubling news out of his mind. The start of the academic year was only a week away, and there were too many things to prepare.

The academy had provided him with Gaya Credit, a currency exclusive to members of the Republic Navy. Each credit was worth ten Guldian—the regular currency used by civilians. With Gaya Credit in his account, Ivor felt a new sense of privilege. This was his first taste of elite status, and he relished it.

“This is what it means to belong,” he thought as he scrolled through the academy’s shopping app, adding items to his cart.

The streets of Kroko’s high-end shopping district buzzed with life as Ivor made his way through uniform shops and specialty stores, checking off every item on the academy’s requirements list.

    Cadet uniforms made from sharp, high-quality fabric.
    Polished boots that gleamed under the shop lights.
    Personalized bedding embroidered with the academy’s crest.

The feeling of handing over Gaya Credit instead of regular Guldians gave him a small thrill. He watched the shopkeepers treat him with respect and deference, their attitudes shifting the moment they saw his navy credentials.

This was the life he had worked for. No more worrying about worn-out shoes or secondhand clothes. He was part of the Republic Navy now.

---

As Ivor returned to his apartment, his arms laden with shopping bags, a sense of satisfaction settled over him.

This was where he belonged. Not in Libre, surrounded by uncertainty and fear, but here—in Kroko, where power and opportunity thrived.

Whatever was happening back home didn’t concern him. His focus was here, at Gaya Maeda, where the future awaited. He had everything he needed—the clothes, the credit, the connections. All that remained was to walk through those gates and claim what was his.

And he wouldn’t let anything—or anyone—get in his way.
