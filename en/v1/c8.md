# Chapter 8: The Ceremony Begins

The sky above Gaya Maeda’s port was a clear, brilliant blue, with sunlight reflecting off the polished brass instruments of the academy’s marching band. Rows of pristine white cadet uniforms shimmered under the midday sun. Hundreds of guests, family members, and naval officers filled the seats in the grandstand, ready to witness the graduation ceremony.

At the far end of the port, a training barque sat anchored, its sails folded neatly, the cannons polished and prepared for the traditional graduation salute.

The marching band, composed of graduating cadets and current cadets, stood at perfect attention. The musicians’ faces were impassive, their instruments ready to sound off one last time for their senior comrades. The drum major—a final-year cadet—stood at the front, holding his commander’s stick like a king with a scepter, leading the event with sharp, precise movements.

The first note broke the silence, a jubilant and powerful burst of brass that resonated across the port. The music was fast, sharp, and celebratory—a farewell to the graduating class, honoring their years of hard work. The cadets on stage played with precision and pride, their music speaking louder than any words. The drum major's every movement was meticulously planned—every beat an order, every note an expression of respect.

The graduates who weren’t part of the band stood in formation, rigid and proud, while their family members in the audience beamed with pride or wiped away tears. No words were exchanged by the band members—only music and motion. The event was about discipline, respect, and tradition, marking the end of one journey and the beginning of another.

When the music reached its final crescendo, the drum major ceremonially handed over the commander’s stick to the next drum major—the one who would lead the academy’s field band for the coming year. The two cadets saluted each other, a formal and solemn gesture. The graduating cadets’ time had come to an end.

The band marched away from the port, their steps synchronized with the cheerful sound of a sea shanty, the lively tune filling the air as they disappeared from sight. The crowd clapped politely, watching them go—until the music faded and the band was no longer visible.

Once the band had left, Lower Commodore Don Eriko Sanco, known to the cadets as Commodore Don, stepped forward. His weathered face remained stern as he addressed the graduates, but the flicker of approval in his eyes showed his pride.

Without a word, Commodore Don handed the ceremonial assault rifle to the drum major of the graduating class. The cadet, standing tall and dignified, took the rifle with both hands, understanding the weight of tradition that accompanied it.

The graduates raised their hands in a crisp salute. At the same moment, a three-round salvo blasted from the training barque’s cannons, the booming sound echoing over the harbor waters.

The graduates had earned their place, and their journey at Gaya Maeda was over.

Just beyond the gates of Gaya Maeda, 500 new cadets stood at attention in long, disciplined ranks. The ceremony was being projected onto a screen above the gates, where they could watch every detail of the graduation. None of them were allowed inside the academy grounds yet—not until they were formally welcomed.

The energy among the new cadets was electric. The ceremony was awe-inspiring, a glimpse into the future they all hoped to achieve. Many felt nervous but excited, standing in formation under the strict gaze of senior cadets who were already inspecting their lines for the smallest mistake.

Then, as the ceremony ended and the projector screen faded to black, the massive iron gates of Gaya Maeda began to open.

A senior cadet’s voice boomed over the assembly.
“Battalion, forward, march!”

The command echoed like a gunshot. The new cadets, hearts pounding, stepped forward as one, their footsteps clattering against the stone path.

The gates of Gaya Maeda had opened for them—this was their moment.

---

As soon as the first line of cadets stepped through the gates, the marching band began to play again. But this time, the music was different—faster, harsher, more aggressive. The rhythm pressed against the cadets, driving them forward, each note sharper than the last.

Then, to their surprise, lyrics rose over the music—a dark, taunting song:

Welcome, o cadet, of Gaya Maeda
Why took so long for you to come
It has been years since we were you
Now you’ll feel the blue

Listen to the sound of a bunch of cadets
That we once were and cannot forget
Forget all you know before, ‘cause you know nothing
Welcome, new cadet, to Gaya Maeda

The song repeated, the sharp, relentless beat pressing the cadets forward. The melody felt both celebratory and menacing, as if welcoming the new cadets while warning them of the trials ahead.

Many of the new cadets felt confused, even unsettled by the lyrics. Some whispered nervously to each other, wondering what the song’s message really meant. Others marched silently, intimidated by the aggressive tone.

But Ivor felt alive. The music filled him with pride—this was his moment. His heart soared as the band played, every beat making him feel more welcome, more important.

“They’re playing this for us,” he thought, his chest swelling with pride. “This is what it means to belong.”

---

The band led the new cadets deeper into the academy grounds, the aggressive music driving them forward with relentless energy. But then, suddenly, the music stopped.

Ivor blinked, snapping out of his daydreams. Silence fell over the assembly. The marching band had disappeared, and the senior cadets who had been leading them were nowhere to be seen.

Confusion rippled through the ranks. Cadets glanced around, murmuring nervously. No one knew where to go—or what to do next.

Ivor’s heart raced. This was the first time he felt uncertainty creep in. The structured rhythm of the band was gone, and without it, there was no one to follow.

A thought crossed his mind—someone needed to take the lead. If no one else would, then he would.

Determined, Ivor began moving to the front of the line, preparing to take charge. But before he could reach the head of the formation, a thunderous voice shattered the silence.

---

“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!”

The voice hit like a whipcrack, stopping Ivor in his tracks. It boomed through the air like a thunderstorm, freezing every cadet where they stood.

“IS THIS WHAT YOU’RE CAPABLE OF?! A BUNCH OF INCOMPETENT RETARDS?!”

The words stung, sharp and unforgiving. Ivor’s heart pounded in his chest. He strained to see where the voice was coming from, but the source was hidden far ahead, beyond the gates of the port.

“ALL OF YOU DON’T BELONG HERE!”

The last line hit Ivor like a punch to the gut. His blood ran cold. Who was this person? Why would someone try to ruin such a prestigious event?

Before he could make sense of the situation, another voice echoed through the air, even harsher.

“I WILL START THE ELIMINATION PROCESS! I WILL EXECUTE YOU!”

Suddenly—the sound of gunfire.

A series of sharp, deafening cracks split the air, sending cadets diving to the ground in panic. Ivor’s instincts kicked in, and he crouched low, pressing himself against the stone path. Around him, shouts and screams erupted as the new cadets scrambled for cover, confusion and fear spreading like wildfire.
