# Chapter 9: Baptism by Fire

The gunfire echoed across the plaza, the sharp cracks of the rifle filling the air with terror. New cadets screamed and scrambled for cover—some collapsed, frozen in fear; others dove to the ground, pressing themselves against the cold stone in desperation.

Ivor crouched instinctively, heart pounding, the weight of panic pressing down on him like an iron hand. Every instinct told him to stay low and survive. Around him, the chaos unfolded mercilessly—some cadets lay flat, sobbing, while others stood frozen in place, too terrified to move.

Then, as suddenly as it began, the gunfire stopped.

A chilling silence fell over the plaza, broken only by the distant click of an empty magazine. The cadet with the rifle—a graduate drum major—lowered the weapon with a smug grin.

He raised his voice for all to hear:
“The incompetent are executed.”

Ivor’s heart skipped a beat. He understood immediately—this had been a test. The bullets were blanks. No one had actually been shot, but the damage was done—those who collapsed or froze would be eliminated on the spot.

Ivor quickly scanned the cadets around him. Some were lying flat, faces pale with terror, while others crouched, trembling but still in control.

His gaze landed on someone nearby—Mikael Otoapedi, lying limp on the ground.

A grin spread across Ivor’s face. "He’s done," Ivor thought, a wave of triumph washing over him. Mikael had failed. There was no way the academy would keep him now. This time, Mikael was out for good.

---

Suddenly, a loud voice cut through the silence, booming across the plaza like a drill sergeant’s bark.
“EVERYONE WHO TOOK COVER, STAY LOW!”

Ivor’s head jerked up toward the voice. A stern-faced NCO wearing a bright red hat stood at the far end of the plaza, rifle slung over his shoulder. His expression was hard as iron, his voice full of authority.

“Crouch down and move to your assigned barracks!” the NCO barked. “Your field uniforms are waiting on your beds. Change immediately and assemble at the plaza—NOW!”

He pointed at the cadets who had frozen in fear or collapsed.
“If you fell or stood still, YOU ARE OUT!” The statement landed like a death sentence. “YOU DON’T BELONG HERE!”

Ivor grinned smugly. Exactly as I thought.

The NCO raised his rifle, the metal gleaming in the sunlight. “MOVE!” he shouted.

The cadets sprang into action, crouching low as instructed and shuffling toward their barracks. The distance was over 500 meters—a long and grueling journey while crouched low, especially with the senior cadets shouting at them from every direction.

---

The new cadets moved as fast as they could, legs burning from the awkward crouching position. Senior cadets followed close behind, rifles in hand, shouting harsh commands. Every few moments, they fired blanks into the air, the deafening noise sending waves of panic through the formation.

“Move faster, you idiots!” one senior cadet screamed. “Is this how slow you’re gonna be in battle?! Pathetic!”

Another cadet fired a burst of blanks just inches above a struggling cadet’s head. “Get moving, or GET OUT!”

Ivor clenched his teeth, legs aching as he shuffled forward. His heart pounded in his chest, but he refused to falter. This was just another test, and he was determined to pass.

Some cadets broke down along the way, crying or collapsing from exhaustion. The NCOs swooped in immediately, pulling them out of the line and dismissing them on the spot.

Ivor’s thighs burned with every step, but he pushed himself onward, determined not to end up like the weaklings around him.

At the barracks entrance, Nolan Veltras arrived first, panting but steady. He glanced back at the other cadets with a smug grin before disappearing inside to change.

---

By the time Ivor reached the barracks—five minutes after Nolan—his legs felt like they were on fire. But he didn’t waste time. He stripped off his clothes and threw on the field uniform waiting on his bed. The sharp, olive-green fabric clung tightly to his frame, and he laced up his boots as quickly as his aching hands would allow.

BOOM!

A sudden salvo from the training barque fired, shaking the walls of the barracks. The cannon roared again, and again—one shot every five seconds.

Ivor’s heart raced, the sound of the salvos sending adrenaline surging through his veins. He finished tying his boots just as the NCO's voice echoed through the barracks:

“ASSEMBLE AT THE PLAZA, IMMEDIATELY!”

Without hesitation, Ivor bolted from the barracks, joining the stream of cadets running back toward the plaza.

---

The plaza was filled with chaos as the cadets scrambled into position, forming ranks as quickly as they could. Ivor slid into his place, adjusting his posture and trying to steady his breathing.

And then—he saw him.

Mikael Otoapedi.

He was standing calmly in the assembly, wearing his field uniform. And next to him—Leona Kessler.

Ivor’s blood boiled. “How the hell is he still here?”

The sight of Mikael standing there, calm and untouched, made Ivor’s heart pound with rage. The academy had eliminated so many cadets—how had they let Mikael pass?

Without thinking, Ivor stormed forward, fists clenched. His vision blurred with fury. He wasn’t going to let Mikael make a fool of him—not again.

“I’m gonna break his face,” Ivor snarled under his breath, charging toward Mikael.

Before he could get close, Juno Foras and Yorick Elvanis grabbed him by the arms, yanking him back.

“Don’t be an idiot, Yahari!” Juno hissed, her voice low and sharp.

Yorick grinned lazily, though his grip on Ivor’s arm was firm. “As much as I’d love to see a fight, now’s not the time, mate.”

Ivor struggled against their grip for a moment, but the reality of the situation sank in. He couldn’t cause a scene—not yet.

---

Just as Ivor calmed himself, the NCO with the red hat strode to the front of the assembly, his rifle slung over one shoulder. He scanned the assembled cadets with cold, calculating eyes.

“Not what I expected,” the NCO muttered, shaking his head. “Far from it.”

He stepped forward, his voice booming across the plaza.
“You are now part of Gaya Maeda.”

A wave of relief swept through the cadets—but the NCO wasn’t finished.

“But don’t get comfortable,” he warned. “You aren’t full cadets yet. From this moment forward, you are Cadet Candidates.”

His eyes narrowed. “You’ll be leaving for Radit’s Peak to train alongside Army and Air Force candidates. You’ll come back sharper—or not at all.”

He gave a grim smile. “If you survive, maybe—just maybe—you’ll be worthy of Gaya Maeda.”

The NCO stepped back, rifle in hand. “Until then... welcome.”
